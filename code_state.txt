Current focus:
- Validate iOS job create flow, photo persistence, and date input sizing after recent fixes.

What's working:
- Theme toggle uses a custom event bridge and updates reliably on iOS.
- Middleware guard prevents missing env crashes on Vercel.
- Local build passes; Supabase env issues resolved in Vercel.

What's broken:
- Need confirmation that job creation on iPhone no longer lands on “Job not found”.
- Need confirmation that photo uploads persist after save on iPhone.
- Date input width fix needs re-verification on iOS.

Latest files touched:
- app/providers.tsx
- app/settings/page.tsx
- app/jobs/new/page.tsx
- app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx
- app/globals.css
- NOTES.md
- code_state.txt

Commands to run locally:
- npm run build

Last successful end-to-end test:
- Vercel deploy succeeds with Supabase env vars set.

Next 3 concrete steps:
1) Re-test iOS job create flow and confirm detail page loads.
2) Confirm photo uploads persist after job save on iOS.
3) Verify date input width is fixed on iPhone.
