Current focus:
- Validate n8n submit flow and end-to-end estimate pipeline.

What's working:
- Jobs list/detail navigation and offline cache fallback.
- PDF link open actions in job list/detail.
- Job delete now works after adding missing RLS delete policy.

What's broken:
- n8n end-to-end flow still not verified.
- Templates page import error (getAllTemplates not exported) seen in console.

Latest files touched:
- app/api/jobs/[id]/route.ts
- app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx
- lib/config.ts
- supabase/migrations/20260107_normalize_job_statuses.sql

Commands to run locally:
- npm run dev

Last successful end-to-end test:
- Created a job, edited details, and navigated between Jobs and Home.

Next 3 concrete steps:
1) Verify Submit → n8n webhook and downstream AI/PDF flow.
2) Fix templates import error in app/templates/page.tsx.
3) Add error surfacing for ai_error/pdf_error states.
