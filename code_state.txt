Current focus:
- Get Netlify build green after schema/type sync.
- Import workspace pricing via import token.

What's working:
- Customer-aware prompt selection with overrides.
- Pricing fallback order (customer → workspace → default) with median pricing.
- CSV import endpoint with batch insert and import-token auth.

What's broken / pending:
- Netlify needs IMPORT_TOKEN env and redeploy.
- Migration for customers/workspace_pricing_materials must be applied.
- job.customer_id still needs population flow.

Latest files touched:
- app/api/pricing-materials/import/route.ts
- app/api/jobs/[id]/estimate/route.ts
- app/home-content.tsx
- app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx
- supabase/schema.sql
- lib/supabase/database.types.ts

Commands to run locally:
- npm run build

Next 3 concrete steps:
1) Apply supabase/migrations/20260128_add_customers_and_workspace_pricing_materials.sql.
2) Set IMPORT_TOKEN in Netlify and redeploy.
3) Import pricing CSV with x-import-token + workspace_id and verify estimates.
