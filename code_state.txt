Current focus:
- Run Supabase migration for line_item job_items and verify line item/template flows; push commits to GitHub.

What's working:
- Templates save correctly with template_items_json mapped to items.
- Line item UI is available on New/Edit Job with no default rows.
- Save-as-template action is available via the kebab menu.
- Job create/update APIs persist line items as job_items of type line_item.

What's broken:
- GitHub push blocked by network restrictions from the environment.
- n8n end-to-end flow still not verified after recent payload changes.

Commands to run locally:
- npm run dev

Last successful end-to-end test:
- None yet for line items + template save.

Next 3 concrete steps:
1) Run `supabase/migrations/20260109_add_line_item_job_items.sql` in Supabase.
2) Create/edit a job with line items; verify they persist and show in Job Details.
3) Retry `git push` once network access is enabled.
