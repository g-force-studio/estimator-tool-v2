Current focus:
- Validate build and OpenAI estimate flow; push latest commits to GitHub.

What's working:
- Lint passes with no warnings.
- Workspace settings (tax/markup/hourly rate) UI + API are wired.
- OpenAI estimate route exists with image analysis and server-side totals.
- Submit calls estimate route instead of n8n.

What's broken:
- OpenAI estimate flow not yet tested end-to-end.
- GitHub push still pending (network restrictions).

Commands to run locally:
- npm run lint
- npm run build

Last successful end-to-end test:
- Line item edit/save works after RLS policy fix.

Next 3 concrete steps:
1) Run `npm run build` to confirm production build passes.
2) Test Submit → OpenAI estimate flow with photos.
3) Retry `git push` once network access is enabled.
