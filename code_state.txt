Current focus:
- Ensure async estimate flow builds cleanly and deploys with queue + worker.

What's working:
- Supabase types now include estimate_queue and new RPCs for hybrid pricing.

What's broken / pending:
- Need to re-run npm run build to confirm no remaining type errors.

Latest files touched:
- lib/supabase/database.types.ts
- NOTES.md
- code_state.txt

Commands to run locally:
- npm run build

Next 3 concrete steps:
1) Run npm run build to confirm type errors are resolved.
2) Deploy estimate-worker and updated generate-pdf.
3) Apply migration for estimate queue + hybrid search if not yet applied.
