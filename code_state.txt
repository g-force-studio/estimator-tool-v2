Current focus:
- Restore accurate estimates with human-readable material names and clean pricing matches.
- Update prompt templates to discourage SKU/part-number outputs.

What's working:
- Code reverted to 19530fb baseline with selective features reapplied.
- Customer/workspace pricing overrides remain (pricing import API removed).
- Alias matching handles commas/semicolons; snake_case normalization added.
- MISSING PRICE instruction removed from estimate prompt.

What's broken / pending:
- Prompt templates still allow SKU/part-number wording.
- Large catalog (20k+ rows) may reduce matching accuracy.

Latest files touched:
- app/api/jobs/[id]/estimate/route.ts
- app/api/customers/route.ts
- app/api/jobs/[id]/customer/route.ts
- lib/prompts.ts
- supabase/schema.sql
- .gitignore
- NOTES.md
- code_state.txt

Commands to run locally:
- npm run build

Next 3 concrete steps:
1) Update prompt_templates (plumbing + general_contractor) to enforce human-readable material names.
2) Re-run estimate with curated pricing data and verify line item descriptions.
3) If still off, tighten matching thresholds or reduce catalog size.
