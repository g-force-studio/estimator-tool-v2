Current focus:
- Verify line items persist on jobs and template save flow works; run new migration.

What's working:
- Templates now save with items mapped to template_items_json.
- Line item UI exists on New and Edit Job, with optional entry and no default rows.
- Save-as-template action available via kebab menu on job pages (online + offline).

What's broken:
- n8n end-to-end flow still not verified after recent payload changes.

Commands to run locally:
- npm run dev

Last successful end-to-end test:
- None yet for line items + template save.

Next 3 concrete steps:
1) Run `supabase/migrations/20260109_add_line_item_job_items.sql` in Supabase.
2) Create/edit a job with line items; verify they persist and show in Job Details.
3) Save job line items as a template and confirm it appears in Templates.
