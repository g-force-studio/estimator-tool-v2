Current focus:
- Fix AI output wording to use catalog-friendly, human-readable material names.
- Re-test pricing accuracy with global defaults + overrides.

What's working:
- Default pricing now merges with workspace/customer overrides (customer → workspace → default).
- General contractor trade pulls default pricing across all trades.
- Alias matching improved (semicolon split + snake_case normalization).

What's broken / pending:
- AI still emits SKU/part-number style items, leading to missing or incorrect pricing matches.
- Matching accuracy may degrade with large catalogs without tighter thresholds.

Latest files touched:
- app/api/jobs/[id]/estimate/route.ts
- NOTES.md
- code_state.txt

Commands to run locally:
- npm run build

Next 3 concrete steps:
1) Update prompt_templates (plumbing + general_contractor) to require human-readable material names.
2) Re-run estimate to verify pricing accuracy after prompt change.
3) If still off, tighten fuzzy matching (brand token drop + stronger overlap threshold).
