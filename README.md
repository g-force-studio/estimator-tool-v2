## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account and project
- (Optional) Email provider for production invites

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd relaykit
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase

#### Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Wait for the project to be provisioned

#### Run the Database Schema

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the contents of `supabase/schema.sql`
4. Paste and run the SQL script
5. Verify all tables, functions, and policies were created

#### Apply Migrations

Some changes are shipped as incremental migrations. Run the SQL files in `supabase/migrations/` in order:

- `supabase/migrations/20260107_normalize_job_statuses.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20260107_add_profiles.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20260108_add_labor_rates.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20260109_add_line_item_job_items.sql`

#### Set Up Storage Buckets

Follow the instructions in `supabase/storage-setup.md`:

1. Create two private buckets:
   - `job-assets` (for job photos and files)
   - `workspace-logos` (for workspace branding)
2. Apply the RLS policies from the storage setup guide
3. Configure file size limits and allowed MIME types

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
SIGNED_URL_TTL_SECONDS=3600
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
INVITE_TOKEN_PEPPER=your-random-secret-pepper-string-min-32-chars
NEXT_PUBLIC_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-n8n-webhook-url
```

**Important:**
- Get your Supabase URL and keys from **Project Settings > API**
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is server-only and should NEVER be exposed to the browser
- `INVITE_TOKEN_PEPPER` should be a random string (32+ characters) for security
- Generate a secure pepper: `openssl rand -base64 32`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` is required to submit jobs into the n8n pipeline

### 4. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Onboarding Flow

### Creating Your First Workspace

1. Navigate to the app
2. Click "Send magic link" and enter your email
3. Check your email and click the magic link
4. You'll be redirected to the onboarding page
5. Enter your workspace name (e.g., "Acme Construction")
6. Click "Create Workspace"
7. You're now the owner of your workspace!

## AI Prompt Templates

Prompts are scoped per workspace and seeded from `prompt_templates` on workspace creation. Each workspace stores its default prompt in `ai_reference_configs`, and the workspace points to it via `workspaces.default_ai_reference_config_id`.

### Add A New Trade/Prompt

1. Add a `prompt_templates` row for the trade (or bump `version` for an updated prompt).
2. Ensure the trade is allowed in the `workspaces.trade` CHECK constraint.
3. Update the onboarding trade list to include the new option.
4. Run the backfill to seed defaults for existing workspaces:

```bash
WORKSPACE_ID=<workspace-id> RUN_BACKFILL=1 node scripts/verify-workspace-prompts.js
```

### Verify Prompt Selection

```bash
WORKSPACE_ID=<workspace-id> JOB_ID=<job-id> node scripts/verify-workspace-prompts.js
```

### Inviting Team Members

#### Step 1: Create an Invite (Admin/Owner Only)

1. Go to **Settings** (bottom navigation)
2. Click **Members** tab
3. Click **Invite Member**
4. Enter the team member's email address
5. Select their role (Admin or Member)
6. Click **Send Invite**

#### Step 2: Copy the Invite Link

In development (or when email is not configured):
- The invite link will be displayed in the UI
- Copy the full link (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/invite/abc123...`)
- The link is also logged to the server console

In production (with email configured):
- An email will be sent automatically to the invitee
- The email contains the invite link

#### Step 3: Invitee Accepts

1. The invitee clicks the invite link
2. If not logged in, they're prompted to sign in with magic link
3. After authentication, they see the invite details:
   - Workspace name
   - Their assigned role
4. They click **Accept Invitation**
5. They're added to the workspace and redirected to the app

### Invite Link Format

```
{APP_BASE_URL}/invite/{32-character-token}
```

Example:
```
http://localhost:3000/invite/V7StGQjAAvS5gKwYphSEjRYFn7m6pVkL
```

## Troubleshooting Invites

### "Invalid invite token"

**Causes:**
- Token was mistyped or incomplete
- Invite has expired (default: 7 days)
- Invite was already accepted

**Solutions:**
- Double-check the full invite link
- Ask the admin to create a new invite
- Verify the invite hasn't expired in Settings > Members

### "You already belong to a workspace"

**Cause:**
- Each user can only belong to ONE workspace (by design)
- The user is already a member of another workspace

**Solutions:**
- Use a different email address
- Contact the admin of your current workspace to remove you first
- This is a strict constraint to prevent data leakage between workspaces

### "Invite expired"

**Cause:**
- Invites expire after 7 days by default

**Solution:**
- Ask the admin to create a new invite
- Admins can revoke old invites in Settings > Members

### Invite Not Received (Email)

**In Development:**
- Email is not configured by default
- Copy the invite link from the console or UI
- Share the link directly with the invitee

**In Production:**
- Check spam/junk folders
- Verify email provider is configured correctly
- Check server logs for email sending errors
- Use the console link as a fallback

## Email Provider Setup

By default, invites are logged to the console. To send actual emails:

### Option 1: Supabase Email (Easiest)

Supabase provides built-in email for magic links. For custom invite emails:

1. Go to **Authentication > Email Templates** in Supabase
2. Customize the templates as needed
3. Configure SMTP settings if using a custom provider

### Option 2: Custom Email Provider

Implement a custom email provider in `app/api/invites/route.ts`:

```typescript
// Example with SendGrid, Resend, or any provider
import { sendEmail } from '@/lib/email';

// In the POST handler, after creating the invite:
await sendEmail({
  to: validated.email,
  subject: `You're invited to join ${workspaceName}`,
  html: `
    <p>You've been invited to join ${workspaceName} on RelayKit.</p>
    <p><a href="${inviteLink}">Accept Invitation</a></p>
    <p>This invite expires in 7 days.</p>
  `,
});
```

## Offline & Sync Behavior

### How It Works

RelayKit is designed to work seamlessly with intermittent connectivity:

1. **Offline Detection**: The app automatically detects when you go offline
2. **Local Cache**: Recent jobs, templates, and packages are cached in IndexedDB
3. **Draft Persistence**: Job edits are saved locally every second (debounced)
4. **Sync Queue**: Mutations are queued when offline and synced when back online
5. **Upload Queue**: Photos are stored locally and uploaded when connectivity returns

### Offline Indicators

- Yellow banner appears when offline: "📡 You're offline. Showing cached data."
- Cached data is displayed immediately
- Changes are saved locally and synced automatically

### Sync Queue

- **FIFO Processing**: Operations are synced in order
- **Retry Logic**: Failed syncs retry with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 5s, 10s, 30s)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins based on `updated_at` timestamp
- **Manual Trigger**: Syncs automatically on reconnection

### Photo Uploads

- **Offline Queue**: Photos are stored as blobs in IndexedDB
- **Automatic Upload**: Uploads start automatically when online
- **Progress Tracking**: Upload status is tracked per file
- **Retry on Failure**: Failed uploads retry with backoff

### Best Practices

- **Create drafts offline**: Jobs are saved locally and synced later
- **View cached data**: Recent jobs and templates are available offline
- **Avoid conflicts**: Try to sync before making major changes
- **Check sync status**: Look for the offline indicator

## Signed URL Configuration

### What Are Signed URLs?

All files (photos, logos) are stored in private Supabase Storage buckets. To access them, the server generates temporary signed URLs with an expiration time.

### Default TTL

- **Default**: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- **Configurable**: Set `SIGNED_URL_TTL_SECONDS` in `.env.local`

### Changing the TTL

1. Edit `.env.local`:
   ```env
   SIGNED_URL_TTL_SECONDS=7200  # 2 hours
   ```

2. Restart the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. For production, update the environment variable and redeploy

### Automatic Regeneration

The client automatically handles expired URLs:

1. **Detection**: Image load fails with 403 error
2. **Regeneration**: Client calls `/api/packages/[slug]/assets`
3. **Retry**: Image is reloaded with new signed URL
4. **Proactive Refresh**: (Optional) Refresh within 5 minutes of expiry

### Recommendations

- **Short TTL (1-2 hours)**: Better security, more regeneration requests
- **Long TTL (24 hours)**: Fewer requests, URLs valid longer
- **Balance**: Default 1 hour is a good balance for most use cases

## PWA & Offline Capabilities

### Installing as PWA

On mobile devices:
1. Open the app in Safari (iOS) or Chrome (Android)
2. Tap the share button
3. Select "Add to Home Screen"
4. The app will install and open like a native app

### Service Worker

- **App Shell Caching**: Core app files are cached for instant load
- **Package Caching**: Visited packages are cached for offline viewing
- **Image Caching**: Images are cached with size limits
- **Automatic Updates**: Service worker updates automatically

### Cache Management

Caches are bounded to prevent excessive storage:
- **Max Jobs**: 50 recent jobs
- **Max Packages**: 50 visited packages
- **Max Images**: 64 images (30-day expiry)

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format
```

## Deployment

### Netlify (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import the project in Netlify
3. Add environment variables in Netlify dashboard
4. Deploy

### Other Platforms

The app can be deployed to any platform that supports Next.js:
- Netlify
- Railway
- Render
- Self-hosted with Docker

**Important**: Ensure all environment variables are set, especially `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (server-only).

## Security Considerations

### Environment Variables

- **Never commit** `.env.local` to version control
- **Never expose** `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to the browser
- **Use strong secrets** for `INVITE_TOKEN_PEPPER` (32+ characters)

### Row Level Security (RLS)

- All tables have RLS enabled
- Users can only access their workspace data
- Admins have elevated permissions for invites and settings
- Public packages are read-only and safe

### Invite Tokens

- Tokens are hashed with SHA-256 + pepper before storage
- Original tokens are never stored in the database
- Tokens expire after 7 days
- One-time use (marked as accepted)

### File Storage

- All buckets are private
- Signed URLs expire after TTL
- RLS policies restrict access to workspace members
- Service role key required for signing
